# Encryption-Decryption-Programs
Some python projects I made for encrypting and decrypting data using different cryptographic techniques from basic algorithms like Caesar shift to RSA (at some point)

NOTE: Just want to mention that comments in these programs aren't exactly industry standard but more to show you my thought process :)

Caesar Cipher Decrpyption and Encryption program:
This was done in fairly easily in about a day, Caesar shift is not too complicated to work with but the standard way I would say to do this task is using dictionaries but instead I used chr/ord methods instead since it is not often I get to use these methods and I thought it would be nice to use these. Also for decryption of Caesar cipher, I thought it would be too easy to be given the shift key value so it will display every possible outcome (26 outcomes) just for an added layer of challenge. But the hardest part of this was trying to display the final outcome in a nice manner.

Frequency Analysis:
This was completed in just one or two hours and was much simpler than I initally thought. But this is used alongside with any vignere or substitution ciphers that would require and frequency analysis attacks for decrpytion. No libraries are needed :)
